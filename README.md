# Optimization and Decision-Making Models for Business Applications

## Overview

This project was conducted from March 2024 to May 2024 in association with the University of Delaware. The primary objective was to develop Excel-based models to optimize project selection and resource allocation for Ewing Natural Gas and Shelby Shelving. The project implemented linear programming, sensitivity analysis, and ROI calculations using Excel Solver and SolverTable, enhancing the models to handle fractional project participation and exploring budget variations to maximize NPV while adhering to constraints.

## Features

- **Project Selection Optimization:** Developed models to select the most beneficial projects within budget constraints.
- **Resource Allocation:** Optimized the allocation of resources to maximize Net Present Value (NPV).
- **Linear Programming:** Implemented linear programming techniques to solve optimization problems.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Conducted sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of variable changes.
- **ROI Calculations:** Calculated Return on Investment (ROI) for various projects.
- **Excel Solver and SolverTable:** Utilized Excel's Solver and SolverTable for advanced optimization and simulation.

## Installation

1. Download the Excel files from the repository.

2. Open the files in Microsoft Excel.

3. Ensure that the Solver add-in is enabled:
   - Go to `File` -> `Options` -> `Add-ins`.
   - Select `Solver Add-in` and click `Go`.
   - Check the box for `Solver Add-in` and click `OK`.

## Code Examples

### Linear Programming Model

#### Excel Solver Setup
1. Define the decision variables (e.g., project selection).
2. Set up the objective function to maximize NPV.
3. Add constraints (e.g., budget, resource limits).
4. Use Solver to find the optimal solution.

#### Sample Excel Formula
```excel
=SUMPRODUCT(Project_Selection, NPV)
```

### Sensitivity Analysis

#### SolverTable Setup
1. Set up the base model in Excel.
2. Define the parameters to vary (e.g., budget, costs).
3. Run SolverTable to analyze how changes in parameters affect the optimal solution.

### ROI Calculation

#### Sample Excel Formula
```excel
= (Total_Profit - Total_Investment) / Total_Investment
```


## Results

- **Optimal Project Selection:** Determined the best combination of projects to maximize NPV within budget constraints.
- **Resource Allocation:** Efficiently allocated resources to projects, improving overall ROI.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Provided insights into how changes in parameters affect project outcomes.
- **Advanced Decision-Making:** Utilized sophisticated techniques to support strategic decisions.
